# RFM Analysis 
RFM is a marketing technique used to group and analyze the value of customers based on three key characteristics: 
<ul>
Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value
</ul>
This analysis is done to develop the appropriate marketing campaigns for each group of customers.

Recency : How recently a customer has made a purchase.
If they made a purchase recently, the likelihood of them making another purchase is high.
However, if the customer hasn't made a purchase in a while, you may need to bring them back with new promotional offers.
Frequency : How often a customer makes a purchase.
If they purchase often, you will know their spending habits and preferences.
If they make one purchase and never return, they could be a good candidate for a customer satisfaction survey.
Monetary Value : How much money a customer spends on purchases
All purchases are valuable. But if a customer has many recent purchases at a high price point,
you have a valuable returning customer with the potential of becoming a brand loyalist.
However, if a customers' recent purchases are at a low price point, perhaps cross-selling may help increase their spending.
